Hi there !
I'm Gwendal and welcome one my Github !
It's the first time I do something like this. Pretty excited even tho I'm not sure it'll ever be useful.

About me, I'm a 18y/o french guys better known on the internet as MyGg29.
Trying to learn as much programation language as I can, I'm interrested by new technologie and similar. 
Also a sport addict, I can't stay more than a week without doing my favorite sport : Judo. 
Later, I want to work on software security. I love this sector. It's a wide subject but you have to know everything perfectly : I love that.


Well, that's it for now i guess...
If you the people from the internet want some more info about me, I'd gladly answers :)

Ps: sry for the english mistakes. I'm french.
